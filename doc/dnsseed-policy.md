Expectations for DNS Seed operators
====================================

GIANT Core attempts to minimize the level of trust in DNS seeds,
but DNS seeds still pose a small amount of risk for the network.
As such, DNS seeds must be run by entities which have some minimum
level of trust within the GIANT community.

Other implementations of GIANT software may also use the same
seeds and may be more exposed. In light of this exposure this
document establishes some basic expectations for the expectations
for the operation of dnsseeds.

0. A DNS seed operating organization or person is expected
to follow good host security practices and maintain control of
their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their
DNS seed. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are
equally expected to uphold these expectations.

1. The DNS seed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and
functioning GIANT nodes from the public network to
